## Ticket 4 - Low Priority
**Title:**
```
Feature request: Add dark mode toggle to user dashboard
```

**Description:**
```
Multiple users have requested a dark mode option for the dashboard interface. This would improve user experience, especially for users working in low-light environments.

**Requested Features:**
- Toggle switch in user settings
- System preference detection (prefers-color-scheme)
- Persistent theme selection (save to user preferences)
- Smooth transition animation

**User Feedback:**
- 23 users submitted this request in the last month
- Popular request in user feedback portal

**Suggested Implementation:**
- Use CSS variables for theme colors
- Store preference in user profile
- Apply theme on page load

**Priority:**
Low - nice-to-have feature, not blocking any functionality.

**Estimated Effort:**
2-3 days development time
```

## Ticket 5 - High Priority
**Title:**
```
Payment processing failure: Stripe webhook timeout
```

**Description:**
```
Stripe webhook deliveries are timing out, causing payment confirmations to fail. This is preventing order fulfillment.

**Issue:**
- Webhook endpoint: /api/webhooks/stripe
- Timeout: 30 seconds
- Affected webhooks: payment_intent.succeeded, charge.succeeded
- Frequency: ~40% of webhook deliveries

**Error Logs:**
```
[2024-01-15 16:45:23] ERROR: Webhook processing timeout
[2024-01-15 16:45:23] Payment ID: pi_1234567890
[2024-01-15 16:45:23] Processing time: 32.5s (exceeded 30s limit)
```

**Impact:**
- Orders stuck in "pending payment" status
- Customers charged but orders not fulfilled
- Manual intervention required to process orders

**Investigation Needed:**
1. Check database query performance in webhook handler
2. Review external API calls (inventory service, email service)
3. Check for deadlocks or long-running transactions

**Workaround:**
Manually processing payments via Stripe dashboard, but this is not scalable.
```

## Ticket 8 - High Priority
**Title:**
```
Cloud Infrastructure: Memory leak causing server crashes
```

**Description:**
```
Production servers are experiencing memory leaks that lead to crashes and automatic restarts. This is happening approximately every 4-6 hours.

**Symptoms:**
- Memory usage gradually increases from 2GB to 16GB (server limit)
- Application becomes unresponsive
- Automatic restart triggered by health check
- Service downtime: 30-60 seconds per restart

**Affected Services:**
- API Gateway (3 instances)
- User Service (2 instances)
- Notification Service (1 instance)

**Timeline:**
- First noticed: 2 days ago
- Frequency increasing: Now happening every 4-6 hours
- Pattern: Memory grows steadily, no sudden spikes

**Investigation:**
- Heap dumps collected
- No obvious memory leaks in application code
- Suspecting issue with third-party library or connection pooling

**Impact:**
- Brief service interruptions
- Potential data loss if requests are in-flight during restart
- Degraded user experience

**Urgency:**
Need memory profiling and fix ASAP before it affects more users.
```

## Ticket 9 - Medium Priority
**Title:**
```
User Management: Bulk user import failing for large files
```

**Description:**
```
The bulk user import feature fails when uploading CSV files with more than 1,000 rows. Smaller files work fine.

**Issue:**
- File size limit: Not the issue (files are under 10MB)
- Row limit: Fails at ~1,000 rows
- Error: "Request timeout" after 60 seconds

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Navigate to Admin > Users > Bulk Import
2. Upload CSV with 1,200 user records
3. Click "Import Users"
4. Progress bar shows processing
5. After 60 seconds, error: "Request timeout"

**Expected:**
Should process all rows, even if it takes longer. Could show progress or process in background.

**Workaround:**
Splitting large files into chunks of 500 rows, but this is tedious.

**Request:**
1. Increase timeout or implement background processing
2. Add progress indicator for large imports
3. Consider chunked processing on backend

**Affected Users:**
Enterprise customers who need to import hundreds of users regularly.
```
